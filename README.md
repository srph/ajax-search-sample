# basic-phonebook-ajax

An example of AJAX search (with PHP), serves as a guide to newbies.

You may learn from the annotated source.

## Running

### Requirements:

PHP ```5.4~``` and a webserver, that's it.

\* If you're using Ubuntu, you may follow [DigitalOcean's tutorial to install the lamp stack on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu).

### Installation

Clone to your machine

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/srph/basic-phonebook-ajax.git
```

If you're feeling lazy, you may run PHP's built-in webserver (```SAPI```):

```bash
# on the root folder
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Then, access in your browser through ```localhost:8000```

## Acknowledgement

I wrote this thing for a friend in need, thanks to him. Not the best guide out there, but I hope newcomers could learn a thing or two from it.
