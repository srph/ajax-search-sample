A sample app implementing AJAX search (with PHP), serves as a guide to newbies.

You may learn from the annotated source.

## Preview / Demo

Check the [demo](https://phonebook-ng-pogi.herokuapp.com/), deployed on Heroku.

I don't like bombarding someone's screen with ***HQ*** screenies, so here's a set of links instead:

## Running

### Requirements:

PHP ```5.4~``` and a webserver, that's it.

\* If you're using Ubuntu, you may follow [DigitalOcean's tutorial to install the lamp stack on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu).

### Installation

Clone to your machine

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/srph/phonebook-ng-pogi.git
```

If you're feeling lazy, you may run PHP's built-in webserver (```SAPI```):

```bash
# `root` of cloned folder
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Then, access in your browser through ```localhost:8000```

## FAQ

Q: **Why is ```index.php``` is a ```PHP``` file when it does not do anything ```PHP``` related?

Heroku seems to require index.php to detect the repository as a PHP repository, dear.

Q: **Where do I start?**

You should start analyzing the ```PHP``` before you hop on to the ```HTML``` file.

Q: **Can I use MySQL?**

Yes, you can always use any type of data storage, **really**. Just that I found simple array of data for an example to be enough.

Q: **This AJAX thing seems to be tedious**

This could be simplified.

On the other note: Not only the AJAX-processing thing is tedious, if your system expands to something big, you need to start using a front-end framework, my friend.

## Acknowledgement

I wrote this thing for a friend in need, thanks to him. Not the best guide out there, but I hope newcomers could learn a thing or two from it.
